# Python - Async

This project focuses on asynchronous programming in Python using asyncio.

## Learning Objectives

- async and await syntax
- How to execute an async program with asyncio
- How to run concurrent coroutines
- How to create asyncio tasks
- How to use the random module

## Requirements

- Python 3.9
- Ubuntu 20.04 LTS
- pycodestyle (version 2.5.x)
- All files must be executable
- All files must end with a new line
- First line of all files: `#!/usr/bin/env python3`
- All functions and coroutines must be type-annotated

## Tasks

0. **0-basic_async_syntax.py** - Basic async syntax with wait_random
1. **1-concurrent_coroutines.py** - Execute multiple coroutines concurrently
2. **2-measure_runtime.py** - Measure runtime of async functions
3. **3-tasks.py** - Create asyncio Tasks
4. **4-tasks.py** - Execute multiple tasks concurrently
